run_reg.information_text_step_3_runid_381530=If you already own a chip, select 'I own a chip' and enter your chip number (seven letters) below.<br><br>\r\n\r\nIf you don't own a chip, select 'Rent a chip' below, you will receive a disposable chip (included in the entry fee) with your race material.   Because the chip is disposable it is not possible to use it in other runs unless the chip is returned and programmed again for the next run.<br><br>\r\n\r\nEnvironmentally friendly.</b>\r\nThe chip is included in the entry fee and therefore competitors can keep the chip as a souvenir if they wish to.  If you do not wish to keep the chip, please return it to the organizers after the run.
